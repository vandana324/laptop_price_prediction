# ðŸ’» Laptop Price Prediction using Streamlit

A machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit that predicts the price of a laptop based on its specifications. Users can input features like brand, RAM, storage, and processor, and get an instant estimated price.

This app uses a trained Random Forest model and is built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It provides a clean and interactive UI for real-time prediction based on real-world laptop data.

**Features:**
- Input laptop specifications (brand, RAM, SSD, GPU, etc.)
- Instant price prediction using ML model
- Clean and responsive interface via Streamlit
- Based on real-world dataset with preprocessing and feature engineering

**How to Run Locally:**
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-price-predictor.git && cd laptop-price-predictor`

2. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib`

3. Run the app:  
   `streamlit run app.py`
